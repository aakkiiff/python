This project is upgraded version of my old sub-repo python/passwordGen8r/ 
there are 2 files.PasswordGen8_Dcry-V2.py generates a random password according to your parameters and gives you a new password.
then it asks u a secret shift key and encrypts the password and saves the encrypted password to secret.txt file.

the other file,PasswordGen8_Dcry-V2.py is used to decrypt the encrypted password using the SHIFT KEY which was used earlier to encrypt it.
